# Cascade Transferinator ðŸš°

**Cascade Transferinator** is a file transfer tool designed to copy one directory to another in a smooth, sequential flow.

- Skips hidden and system files â€” *only copies what you can see*.  
- **Save progress / resume log** option lets you pause and resume later.  
- Simple **drag-and-drop interface** for source and destination folders.  
- Durable writes using `fsync` ensure your data is safe, even during interruptions.  

ðŸš€ **Usage:**

2. Drag and drop a **destination folder** onto the destination box.  
3. Press **Start** to begin the transfer.
