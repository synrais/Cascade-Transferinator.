# Cascade-Transferinator.
This tool copies files in a smooth, sequential flow.
It avoids choking the system or overfilling caches by processing one file at a time,
completing each folder in cascaded alphabetical order before moving to the next.
Use 'Save progress / resume log' to pause and resume later.
Drag and drop source and destination folders and press Start.
